I worked on a team to design and build a custom syringe pump capable of delivering precise flow rates between 0.1 mL/min and 5 mL/min with compatibility across two syringe sizes. This makes it well-suited for applications in microfluidics, biomedial reasearch, or controlled drug delivery. 

Commercial syringe pumps can cost several hundred dollars, so instead of buying one, our team engineeringed a DIY version. We combined CAD modeling, 3D printing, electrical wiring and Arduino programming to create a reliable device powered by a stepper motor and lead screw. The system integrates flow rate control, limit switches, and LED indicators. These features make it safe, accurate, and user-friendly.
