I designed and fabricated a functional rotating bike phone holder using Fusion 360 and a top-down modeling approach. Beginning with the phone case as the primary reference geometry, I built the clamp, rotating hub, and detent components directly around it to ensure precise alignment and smooth motion. The assembly incorporates a spring-loaded detent mechanism that enables the phone to snap cleanly between portrait and landscape orientations, along with a TPU phone case that provides a tight, cushioning grip during riding.

# Pairing of Powder Bed Fusion and Generative Design 
<p style="font-size: 1.1em; color: #666; margin-top: -0.8em; font-style: italic;">
The unique pairing of powder bed fusion and generative design and their
applications in either aerospace or automotive industries. Please research a
specific commercial example (not on the slides), where generative design has
been used to reduce the number of components in an assembly.

# Importance of Applying Proper Load Cases
<p style="font-size: 1.1em; color: #666; margin-top: -0.8em; font-style: italic;">
The importance of applying the proper load cases and how to improve this
process. How did you determine which forces to apply to the model? Where did
you place the structural constraint and how will this placement affect the
outcome?

# Features

* **Functional Print-in-Place Joint Design:** The rigid plier arms are modeled with precise clearance at the pivot, enabling smooth rotation directly after printing. Joints were refined across iterations to minimize binding and reduce crunchy motion.
* **Reopening Spring Mechanism:** A TPU 95A flexible insert acts as a mechanical spring, automatically returning the pliers to their open state. Various thicknesses and geometries were tested to balance flexibility, durability, and comfortable operation.
* **Press-Fit Multi-Material Assembly:** While intended as a print-in-place device, the final design incorporates three components—two rigid handles and one TPU spring—assembled by hand without adhesives or tools. Press-fit mating was parameterized to achieve secure retention.
