I designed and fabricated functional print-in-place needle-nose pliers using Fusion 360 and additive manufacturing. The device consists of two rigid arms and a flexible TPU spring element that returns the pliers to an open position when not in use. Through iterative prototyping and tolerance testing, I refined the spring geometry and press-fit interfaces to ensure smooth motion, reliable grip, and tool-free assembly. This project strengthened my skills in parametric CAD, mechanism design, and multi-material printing, resulting in a compact set of pliers suitable for handling small electronic components.

# Features

* **Functional Print-in-Place Joint Design:** The rigid plier arms are modeled with precise clearance at the pivot, enabling smooth rotation directly after printing. Joints were refined across iterations to minimize binding and reduce crunchy motion.
* **Reopening Spring Mechanism:** A TPU 95A flexible insert acts as a mechanical spring, automatically returning the pliers to their open state. Various thicknesses and geometries were tested to balance flexibility, durability, and comfortable operation.
* **Press-Fit Multi-Material Assembly:** While intended as a print-in-place device, the final design incorporates three components—two rigid handles and one TPU spring—assembled by hand without adhesives or tools. Press-fit mating was parameterized to achieve secure retention.

# How to Operate the Multi-Material Pliers
1. Position the tips around the intended object to be picked up.
2. Squeeze the handles to close the jaws. 
3. Lift pliers and object from original position and move to final position. 
4. Release pressure to allow the spring to reopen and release the object.
