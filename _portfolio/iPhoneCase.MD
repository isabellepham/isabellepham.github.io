I created my own design of an iPhone 15 case using Fusion 360 and additive manufacturing. The case includes protective features around the screen and camera, while also integrating a unique design element of cut out flower for aesthetics. Through iterative prototyping and testing, I explored the benefits and limitations of flexible TPU filament in FFF printing. This project gave me hands-on experience in CAD modeling, parametric design, and design-for-manufacturing - resulting in a functional, customized phone case. 

# Features

* **Precision Fit & Full Protection.** The phone case was modeled using Apple’s official accessory design guidelines to ensure an exact fit for the iPhone. All sides of the device, including the camera bump and touchscreen edges, are fully protected while maintaining access to essential functions. The snug fit ensures drop and impact resistance without adding unnecessary bulk.
* **Button & Port Accessibility.** Careful parametric design allows the case to provide tactile, responsive access to the volume and power buttons, mute switch, and charging port. The openings are dimensioned to avoid blocking speakers, microphones, or cameras, ensuring the phone’s full functionality is preserved.
* **Flexible & Durable TPU Construction.** Printed in PolyMaker TPU 95A filament, the case combines flexibility with toughness. TPU absorbs shock from drops while retaining shape after repeated use, outperforming rigid plastics such as PLA for protective applications.
* **Parametric Customization.** The CAD model was fully parameterized, allowing rapid resizing of key dimensions (length, width, thickness) within ±2 mm to compensate for printer tolerances or different iPhone models. This adaptability makes it easy to iterate on prototypes and ensures a perfect fit across variations.
* **Functional / Aesthetic Enhancements.** Beyond protection, the design incorporates a unique functional or aesthetic element (e.g., integrated grip, stand, or patterned backplate) to improve usability and distinguish the case from generic designs.
